# OQ_Avatar_Mapping

Mapping from Oculus Quest (and other VR control systems) to an  
apparently standardized avatar used my Mozilla Hubs here 
https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-avatar-pipelines/tree/master/Blender/AvatarBot 
and generated by readyplayer.me.

Based on a copy of the OQ_Toolkit directory copied in from here:
https://github.com/NeoSpark314/godot_oculus_quest_toolkit/

(It would be preferable to bring in this OQ_Toolkit dependency from the AssetLib rather than include 
it in this repo, but without it the project cannot be opened because it derives 
nodes directly from its contents.)

The binary addons vr drivers are not included.  

Fetch the godot-openvr one from the godot AssetLib

Copy the godot_ovrmobile one from the https://github.com/NeoSpark314/godot_oculus_quest_toolkit/tree/master/addons/godot_ovrmobile 
until the AssetLib one is updated.
